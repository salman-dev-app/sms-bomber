## Project Overview
sms-bomber is a code repository containing tools and web assets related to automated SMS request flows. The repository contains Python code and HTML frontend components. The purpose of the project, as presented in this repository, is not described here in detail due to the potential for misuse.

This README is intended to:
- Provide a professional, clear description of the repository structure.
- Document development, contribution, and maintenance guidelines.
- Emphasize security, legal, and ethical boundaries for any testing or research.

Repository: [salman-dev-app/sms-bomber](https://github.com/salman-dev-app/sms-bomber)

## Intended Use & Disclaimer
WARNING: The code in this repository may be capable of sending large numbers of SMS requests and could be misused to harass, spam, or otherwise harm individuals, services, or networks.

- This repository must only be used for lawful, ethical, and authorized purposes such as:
  - Defensive security research in controlled environments
  - Load-testing with express permission from the target service owner
  - Academic study under appropriate oversight
- Do not use this code to target people, businesses, or services without explicit, written authorization.
- The repository owner and contributors are not responsible for misuse.

I cannot provide operational instructions that would enable mass messaging, spamming, or harassment. If you are the repository owner and want a README that includes safe, authorized testing procedures, configuration templates that do not operate against third-party services, or sanitized examples, confirm your intent and that you will only use this for legitimate testing.

## Key Features (High-level)
- Python backend components (server-side scripts and utilities).
- HTML-based frontend assets (user interface templates).
- Minimal process configuration (Procfile noted in repository composition).

Note: Implementation details and runnable usage examples are intentionally omitted from this public README to reduce the risk of misuse.

## Repository Composition
According to repository language statistics:
- Python — 61.3%
- HTML — 38.6%
- Procfile — 0.1%

This suggests the repository mixes server-side Python code with web UI assets.

## Architecture & Files of Interest
The following is a non-actionable overview of common areas you may find in projects like this. Replace these placeholders with the actual file paths in your repository if you want them documented here.

- src/ or app/ — Python application code (business logic, utilities)
- templates/ or static/ — HTML, CSS, JS assets for any frontend
- Procfile — process declarations for deployment platforms (e.g., Heroku)
- docs/ — design, architecture, or developer notes
- tests/ — unit or integration test suites

If you'd like, I can enumerate the actual files and generate a file-by-file summary — but I will omit any step-by-step usage or instructions that enable misuse.

## Development & Contribution
This project follows standard open-source practices. If you intend to contribute responsibly, ensure your changes comply with the security and legal guidance below.

Contributing guidelines (recommended):
1. Fork the repository and work on a feature branch.
2. Keep commits focused and atomic; include tests where appropriate.
3. Open a pull request that:
   - Describes the change clearly
   - Includes reasons and tests
   - Confirms that the changes do not introduce functionality that could be misused
4. Maintainers will review for code quality, security, and compliance with this repository's ethical policy.

Please include a Code of Conduct and CONTRIBUTING.md in the repository if you accept external contributions.

## Security, Ethics & Legal
Security-first guidance:
- Do not perform testing against live third-party endpoints without written authorization.
- When testing services, use a dedicated, isolated lab network or a sandbox provided explicitly for load/security testing.
- Remove or redact any hard-coded credentials, API keys, or personal data before committing or sharing code.

Reporting vulnerabilities:
- If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository or related infrastructure, follow responsible disclosure:
  - Do not publish details publicly
  - Contact the maintainers directly (use the repository Issues or email address in the project metadata)

Legal notice:
- The user of this repository is fully responsible for how they operate the code.
- Misuse of the code may violate local, national, and international laws — including laws against harassment, denial of service, and unauthorized access.

## Maintainers & Contact
Repository: [salman-dev-app/sms-bomber](https://github.com/salman-dev-app/sms-bomber)

If you are the repository owner and want tailored, responsible documentation (for example: a sanitized development setup, architecture diagrams, or a security testing checklist), state that you are the owner and confirm the intended, authorized use. I can then help produce more specific README content that excludes any instructions which could facilitate abuse.

## Acknowledgements
- Refer to any third-party libraries, frameworks, or templates used in the project (please add exact packages/URLs here).
- Thank contributors and list notable references.

## License
Please include a LICENSE file in the repository and link to it here. If you need help choosing a license, common options are:
- MIT — permissive, simple
- Apache 2.0 — permissive with patent grant
- GPLv3 — copyleft

Add the exact license link (for example: [LICENSE](https://github.com/salman-dev-app/sms-bomber/blob/main/LICENSE)) once the file is present.

---

If you want, I can:
- Generate a cleaned, ready-to-commit README.md replacing placeholders with actual file paths and a safe development checklist (no usage instructions that could enable misuse).
- Or, if you are the repo owner and confirm lawful, authorized usage (and provide brief details about the allowed testing scenario), I can produce a version that includes sanitized, non-abusive examples and clear operational constraints.

Which option do you prefer?
